# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of our project receives official security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage users and security researchers to report vulnerabilities in a responsible
manner. We'll work in collaboration with you to find and implement a solution and inform
the community as soon as possible. Please report any (potential) vulnerabilities via
email to [opensource@bdr.de](opensource@bdr.de).

## Security Process

1. Your report will be reviewed, and you'll receive a response within one week
   confirming its receipt.
2. The team will investigate the issue and provide you with an initial assessment and
   expected resolution timeline within two weeks.
3. Once the incident has been resolved, the team will add either a Fix or a Known Issue
   to the Release Notes.
